      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
    
      <p>This document describes a game called "The Creature from Roth Pond", which is designed to be a simple, 2D puzzle-platformer. The game will employ sprite-based animation, tiled backgrounds, collision detection, physics, AI, side scrolling & gravity, efficient memory management, render threading, and more basic 2D game techniques.</p>
    <br>
    
      <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
    
      <p>The Creature from Roth Pond will be developed for the Windows Platform using the McKilla's Gorilla game engine, which is a bare-bones engine developed by Richard McKenna for rapid prototyping 2D games. DirectX will be used as the underlying rendering technology. XACT will be used for all music and sound effects management.</p>
    <br>
    
      <h3>BACK STORY</h3>
    
      <p>One day, a sea bass was taken by a sandhill crane and while flying over Long Island, the bird accidentally drops its meal into the murky waters of Roth Pond. The chemical reaction caused by this foreign biomatter interacting with the ecologically dubious substances of the pond triggers rapid mutation. This fish crawls out of the water with abnormal human legs. Now the fish is on the run from the surrounding humans and must reckon with its newfound existence as a man-made abomination.</p>
    <br>
    
      <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>
    
      <p>The fish’s task is to survive and move forward (right). The fish doesn’t have any capacity towards violence and must use its wits and stealth in order to get by. There are a variety of locations with different enemies as well as puzzles such as the underground sewers and its rats or the school and its campus security.</p>
    <br>
    
      <h3>GAMEPLAY</h3>
    
      <p>The game will be a 2D side-scrolling adventure with puzzle-solving elements. The player will control the mutated fish and navigate through different environments, using its unique abilities to overcome obstacles and enemies. The fish can walk in all directions, jump, and manipulate objects in the environment.</p>
    
      <p>The game will be divided into levels, each with its own unique environment and challenges. The levels will be interconnected, creating a continuous world for the player to explore. The game's difficulty will increase as the player progresses through the levels, introducing new enemies and puzzles.</p>
    <br>
    
      <h3>CONTROLS</h3>
    
      <p>This game will be played using both a keyboard and mouse. Once started, use the following:</p>
    
       <ul>
        <li><strong>A</strong> - Move Left</li>
        <li><strong>D</strong> - Move Right</li>
        <li><strong>LEFT-ARROW</strong> - Move Left (same as A)</li>
        <li><strong>RIGHT-ARROW</strong> - Move Right (same as D)</li>
        <li><strong>SPACE</strong> - Jump</li>
        <li><strong>E</strong> - Interact with surrounding objects</li>
        <li><strong>ESC</strong> - This pauses the game and presents the in-game menu. If a game is not in progress, ESC does nothing.</li>
       </ul>
    <br>
    
      <h3>GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE</h3>
    
      <p>As far as the GUI is concerned, if we consider</p>
    
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Splash Screen</strong> - The splash screen GUI simply presents a game logo and a Start button for the user to press when they are ready to play. Upon pressing it, a brief scripted cutscene is played showcasing the events leading up to the game (the fish being taken, falling into the pond, the newly-mutated fish stepping out of the water). While playing the message "Press ESC to Skip'' should be displayed at the bottom of the screen. If pressed, the game should immediately start.</li>
    <br>

       <li><strong>In-Game Menu</strong> - When the game is paused by pressing ESC, we'll have a game menu that allows the player to select from the following options:
        <ul>
         <li><strong>New Game</strong> - If a game is in progress, first we'll pop up a dialog to make sure the user really wants to quit the current game. If we conclude the user really wants to start a game, then the game state is reset and begun.</li>
         <li><strong>Display Controls</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen that includes a description of all game controls.</li>
         <li><strong>About</strong> - If pressed, the game will display an info screen with information about the game author.</li>
         <li><strong>Exit</strong> - If pressed, the game program will exit.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <br>

       <li><strong>In-Game GUI</strong> - The game will have a very minimal in-game GUI with text showing the mechanics (press space to jump, E to interact, etc).</li>
    <br>

      <h3>ARTWORK</h3>
    
      <p>All artwork in the game will be original. The following needs to be created:</p>
    
      <ul>
       <li><strong>Mutated Fish</strong> - We’ll only need artwork for the fish before and after its transformation with the former only being shown during the opening cutscene and the latter being how the fish looks throughout the rest of the game. Each will require animations for:
        <ul>
         <li>Walking Right</li>
         <li>Walking Left</li>
         <li>Jumping Right</li>
         <li>Jumping Left</li>
         <li>Jumping Up</li>
         <li>Grabbing object with mouth</li>
         <li>Dying</li>
        </ul></li>
    
    <br>
    
       <li><strong>Backgrounds</strong> - The levels each need their own backgrounds so images such as sewers, artistic renderings of the school grounds, etc.</li>
    <br>
    
       <li><strong>Ceiling, Floor, &amp; Wall Tiles</strong> - The levels will have multiple floors and platforms to jump onto and off of. We'll use simple tiles for all walkable/collidable surfaces. These tiles will have to clearly define where the walkable surface is. We'll use straight, dark gray, slightly grooved walking surfaces.</li>
    <br>
    
       <li><strong>Interactable Objects</strong> - Simple objects for puzzles such as barrels, boxes, and so on are needed.</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
    
    
      <h3>SOUND EFFECTS</h3>
    
      <p>All sound effects will be original. Sounds must be made to coincide with each of the following events:</p>
       <ul>
        <li><strong>Walking</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Landing on a Platform</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Spike Dying</strong></li>
       </ul>
    <br>
    
      <h3>MUSIC</h3>
    
      <p>Game Music will be added when time permits.</p>
